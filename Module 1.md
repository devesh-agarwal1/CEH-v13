# CEH Exam Notes: Module 01 - Introduction to Ethical Hacking

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of ethical hacking, information security, and the different types of attackers and their methodologies.

## 1. Information Security Concepts

Information security focuses on protecting information and information systems from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

### 1.1 Elements of Information Security

The core principles of information security are:

-   **Confidentiality (C):** Ensuring information is accessible only to those authorized to have access. Prevents data leakage and unauthorized disclosure.
    
-   **Integrity (I):** Maintaining the trustworthiness and accuracy of data. Ensures that data has not been tampered with or corrupted. Uses checksums, hashes.
    
-   **Availability (A):** Guaranteeing that systems and information are accessible and usable when required by authorized users. Prevents Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.
    
-   **Authenticity:** Ensuring the quality of being genuine or uncorrupted. Verifying the identity of users and the origin of data (e.g., biometrics, smart cards, digital certificates).
    
-   **Non-Repudiation:** A guarantee that the sender of a message cannot later deny having sent the message, and the recipient cannot deny having received it. Achieved using digital signatures.
    

### 1.2 Information Security Attacks: Motives, Goals, and Objectives

Attackers exploit system weaknesses to obtain, edit, remove, destroy, or reveal information.

-   **Motives/Goals of Attacks:**
    
    -   Disrupt business continuity.
        
    -   Perform information theft.

    -   Damage reputation.
        
    -   Take revenge.
        
    -   Demand ransom.
        
-   **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):**
    
    -   **Tactics:** The strategy or overall plan an attacker follows from beginning to end.
        
    -   **Techniques:** Technical methods used by an attacker to achieve intermediate results during an attack.
        
    -   **Procedures:** Systematic approach followed by threat actors to launch an attack.
